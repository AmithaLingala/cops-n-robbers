Cops and Robber is a turn-based 2d platform game where multiple cops try to capture a robber.
Help the robber escape from the cops by reaching the exit.

Available on both Android mobile and Desktop.

## How to play 

- In Android, we can move the robber in any of the four directions by swiping on the screen and in the desktop version we use arrow keys.
- At every moment of the robber, both the cops move towards the robber and try to catch the robber.
- If the robber tries to go through the wall or the obstacles robber will lose the turn.
- Robber can collect coins that are displayed as scores and can collect weapons which will be updated at bottom of the window.
- Robber can use the collected weapons by clicking on available weapons at the bottom which will highlight the positions to throw weapons.
- Weapon is used by clicking on the highlighted cells and can be used to destroy the obstacles and freeze cop for one turn.
- Robber has to escape from the gate on the top left corner to reach the next level.
- Robber can collect as many coins and weapons as before escaping from the gate.
- Cop will catch the robber if the robber falls in the same tile as the cop and the game will end.
